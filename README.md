# some.guides

This repository aims at gathering guides I wrote to set up programs and processes.  
 
For instance, [the first guide](https://github.com/lorismat/some.guides/blob/master/bots/telegram_psql_heroku.md) is suggesting a set of steps to properly set up a Telegram bot along with a PostgreSQL database on Heroku.
